## Template to create my GitHub repositories

1 - The first thing to do after cloning is to 'activate' three hidden files by changing their names locally:

    .template_gitignore to .gitignore
    
    .template_gitconfig to .gitconfig

    .gitattributes to .gitattributes

2 - Choose whether to use the renv R package or not. It is deactivated by default, so it needs to be activated if desired:

    - open .Rprofile file and delete the #s


Enjoy coding!

# Template to create my GitHub repositories

1 - The first thing to do after cloning is to 'activate' three hidden files by changing their names locally:

[template_gitignore.txt](https://github.com/br-amaral/Rep_template/blob/main/template_gitignore.txt) (click here to view the file)
    
    .template_gitconfig to .gitconfig

    .gitattributes to .gitattributes

2 - Choose whether to use the renv R package or not. It is deactivated by default, so it needs to be activated if desired:

    - open .Rprofile file and delete the #'s

3 - The draft script is there as a template, but it should be used/saved as a snippet so it is easier and faster.


## Enjoy coding!
